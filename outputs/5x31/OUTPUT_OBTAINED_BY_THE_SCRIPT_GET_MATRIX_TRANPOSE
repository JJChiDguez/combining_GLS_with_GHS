[STEP #1] WE READ THE MATRIX FROM THE FILES ./outputs/tmp/COEFS AND ./outputs/tmp/INDXS
Time: 0.470
[STEP #2] WE CREATE TWO STRUCTURES THAT DETERMINE THE TRANPOSE OF THE MATRIX
WE DO IT BY USING THE FILES ./outputs/tmp/COEFS AND ./outputs/tmp/INDXS
Time: 7.740
[STEP #3] WE CONSTRUCT THE TRANSPOSE OF THE MATRIX BY USING THOSE TWO STRUCTURES
Time: 0.580
[STEP #4] WE TRANSPOSE THE MATRIX BY USING THE Transpose() FUNCTION
Time: 0.020
Our transpose matrix constructed is equal to magma transpose output? true
[STEP #5] WE CREATE THE FILES ./outputs/tmp/tr_INDXS AND ./outputs/tmp/tr_COEFS
Time: 6.180
[STEP #6] WE READ THE TRANSPOSE OF THE MATRIX FROM THE FILES 
./outputs/tmp/tr_COEFS AND ./outputs/tmp/tr_INDXS
Time: 1.190
Time: 0.000
THE TRANSPOSE OF THE MATRIX CONSTRUCTED BY THE FILES ./outputs/tmp/tr_COEFS AND 
./outputs/tmp/tr_INDXS IS EQUAL TO THE MATRIX CONSTRUCTED BY THE FILES ./outputs/tmp/INDXS AND 
./outputs/tmp/COEFS? true
